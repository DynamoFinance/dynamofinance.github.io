Dynamo vaults allows anyone to participate in their rebalancing process and encourage the decentralisation of the weight rebalancing process by incentivising the process with part of the yield that the respective vaults generate from a rebalancing proposal.

The upcoming integration of Dynamo vaults with the Balancer V2 boosted pool framework will act as a proof of concept by allowing liquidity providers to take advantage of Dynamo's boosted pools in order to optimise their liquidity. Dynamo's infrastructure can accelerate the development of liquidity for decentralised stablecoins and other assets by allowing liquidity providers to generate an optimised lending yield out of their idle liquidity. The integration of Dynamo vaults with stableswap pools will enhance base yields by enabling liquidity providers to use Dynamo pools in order to interact with a multitude of DeFi protocols in a passive manner."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
