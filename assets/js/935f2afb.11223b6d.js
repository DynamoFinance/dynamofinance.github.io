Platforms such as Aave, Compound, and Fraxlend allow their users to generate yield on their capital while keeping custody of their assets. Decentralised lending has facilitated a large part of DeFi\'s growth with the lending pool model becoming the dominant implementation in the space leading to the dominance of utilisation based interest rate models. Thus, in the presence of a surplus of available capital, interest rates on lending protocols decrease. The existence of multiple DeFi protocols leads to interest rate imbalances that come as a result of different utilisation rates in different lending markets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Products/Vault/white-paper":{"id":"Products/Vault/white-paper","title":"Whitepaper","description":"Abstract","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"security":{"id":"security","title":"Security audits","description":"ERC-4626 vault","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
