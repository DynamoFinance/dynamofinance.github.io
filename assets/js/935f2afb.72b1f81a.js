Platforms such as Aave, compound, Euler and Fraxlend allow their users to generate yield on their capital while keeping custody of their assets. Decentralised lending has facilitated a large part of defi\'s growth with the lending pool model becoming the dominant implementation in the space leading to the dominance of utilisation based interest rate models. Thus, in the presence of a surplus of available capital, interest rates on lending protocols decrease. The existence of multiple DeFi protocols leads to interest rate imbalances that come as a result of different utilisation rates in different lending markets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Dynamo/Vaults/governance":{"id":"Dynamo/Vaults/governance","title":"Governance","description":"Dynamo crowd sources optimal wealth allocations across various liquidity/lending platforms.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Dynamo/Vaults/intro":{"id":"Dynamo/Vaults/intro","title":"Introduction","description":"Dynamo vaults are the epicenter of Dynamo\'s infrastructure and their task is to maximise the yield of the assets that liquidity providers and other users provide to the protocol. Dynamo vaults allocate 90% of their liquidity to the underlying lending markets in proportions that are represented by weights that sum up to unity. Vault weights are subject to change through a process that allows independent strategists to submit weight proposals for specific Dynamo vaults in exchange for 1% of the yield that the vaults generate as a result of the proposed allocation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Overview","description":"Welcome to the Dynamo Docs!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
