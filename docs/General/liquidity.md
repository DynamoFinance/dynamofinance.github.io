# Importance of stablecoin liquidity

The stableswap algorithm had a huge impact within DeFi by creating the right
habitat for the development of deep on-chain liquidity for stablecoins and other
pegged assets as it was designed to accommodate large transactions with minimal
price impact.
The development of the stableswap algorithm resulted in Curve[^1] becoming the de-facto standard of DeFi and enabling the acceleration of the decentralized finance revolution.

The stableswap algorithm is built to facilitate deep liquidity for assets that are
pegged with each other such as dollar stablecoins and Bitcoin[^2] derivatives, by
concentrating the majority of a poolâ€™s liquidity around the peg of the underlying
components with the aim of maintaining stability at scale and servicing liquidity
for market participants regardless of their size, while generating yield for liquidity
providers through transaction fees.

The stableswap algorithm was a crucial innovation for the development of DeFi
and led to the buildup of billions of dollars in on-chain stablecoin liquidity enabling
the vast experimentation that took place in the last two years of DeFi development,
but the vast majority of this liquidity was a byproduct of incentivization since
stableswap liquidity provision returns are not sufficient enough to attract liquidity
providers on their own.

Stablecoin holders in DeFi can generate higher yields most of the time by lending
out their assets to third parties through platforms such as Aave[^3] and Compound[^4]
instead of providing stablecoin liquidity, but platforms such as Curve have found
a way to deal with this issue by incentivizing liquidity provision with governance
token rewards with the aim of sourcing liquidity by generating the highest possible
yield for liquidity providers.
