The last month has been exciting in terms of progress that we have been able to make.
Our ERC-4626 vault was examined by [0x52](https://twitter.com/IAm0x52) in a four-day smart-contract security audit.
Our smart-contract team (led by Ben and Sajal) were able to fix all highly and medium classified issues - no critical issue was found that would drain the assets in the vault.

The [full audit report](https://dynamofinance.github.io/docs/security) is available in our docs and we are currently preparing our testnet deployments.
