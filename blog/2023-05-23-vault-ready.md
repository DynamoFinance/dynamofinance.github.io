We finished our ERC-4626 vault development and the boosted pool integration in the Balancer ecosystem!
After an internal code review from Balancer we received also the first tranche of our grant and
are now moving forward to the first smart-contract audit.
The first audit will most probably be happening in early June, and we plan to get a second competitive audit on top.

Keep tuned!

Cheers,

ehjc
